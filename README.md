# Blackjack

## Project Proposal

### Theme
The goal of this project is to sufficiently learn how to develop a game using object-oriented programming. Blackjack was one of the initial ideas, allowing for creation of Cards and Decks which interact with eachother using objects, fulfilling the purpose. 

### List of features
The game will follow the rules of US blackjack. Deck class has-a Card class: creates a deck that can be randomized/redrawn for the dealer and player at the start of a new round. Int inputs can be taken in for the wager, which will then be implemented as the bet placed for the round. During the round, the player can choose to hit and gain a new card, or stand and allow the dealer to draw their cards. Win or lose, the total points owned are updated after the round ends.
